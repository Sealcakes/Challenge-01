# Horiseon On-The-Job Challenge

## Description
The Horiseon project was about sprucing up the webpage so that it would be more accessable for those with disabilities, along with cleaning up the code and fixing any broken elements.

I made numerous changes to the HTML elements, the page was made up of about 90% non descript div elements which I managed to change about 95% of them to semantic elements.
- I added main, header, section, article, aside and footer elements.

I made changes to the CSS code so that it followed the same flow as the HTML elements for easier reading
I also made CSS changes so that it worked properly with the new semantic elements

I added a title to the webpage

I added alt descriptions to all the pictures on the website for screen readers

I fixed a broken link in the nav bar and ensured all were working

Lastly, I added comments to the HTML and CSS outlining specific changes and descriptions to the code
